## STEP 2: First Post (10 minutes)

### X/Twitter Launch Thread

**Tweet 1:**
```
🚨 I'm launching TestiFy today!

The easiest way to collect and display customer testimonials.

Here's why I built it 🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
I spent $200/month on Trustpilot for 2 years.

Then I realized:
• Their widgets are slow
• They plaster their branding everywhere
• I don't own my own reviews

Something had to change.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
So I built TestiFy:

• $9/month (not $200)
• Your branding only
• Full control over what displays
• Setup in 60 seconds
• Beautiful, fast widgets
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
First 50 people get 50% off forever.

That's $4.50/month for life.

Just reply "TESTIFY" and I'll DM you the link.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Your landing page is losing customers without testimonials.

Fix that today 👇

## STEP 3: Reddit Post (5 minutes)

**Subreddit:** r/SaaS

**Title:** "I built a $9/month alternative to Trustpilot"

**Post:**
```
Hey r/SaaS!

I've been running a business for 3 years and always struggled with collecting testimonials.

Existing solutions were either:
• Too expensive ($200+/month)
• Too complicated
• Covered in their own branding

So I built TestiFy - the easiest way to collect and display customer testimonials.

What it does:
• Creates a branded collection page in 60 seconds
• Customers submit via simple link
• You approve/review before publishing
• One-click embed on your website
• $9/month flat

Built with Next.js, MongoDB, Stripe.

Would love your feedback!
