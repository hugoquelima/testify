## DAY 1 (MONDAY) - LAUNCH DAY 🚀

### 9:00 AM - Launch Thread (Post in 5 parts, 10 min apart)

**Tweet 1:**
```
🚨 I'm launching TestiFy today!

The easiest way to collect and display customer testimonials.

Here's why I built it 🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
I spent $200/month on Trustpilot for 2 years.

Then I realized:
• Their widgets are slow
• They plaster their branding everywhere
• I don't own my own reviews

Something had to change.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
So I built TestiFy:

• $9/month (not $200)
• Your branding only
• Full control over what displays
• Setup in 60 seconds
• Beautiful, fast widgets
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
First 50 people get 50% off forever.

That's $4.50/month for life.

Just reply "TESTIFY" and I'll DM you the link.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Your landing page is losing customers without testimonials.

```
Social proof isn't optional anymore.

Your landing page without testimonials = 50% less conversions.

Customers need to trust you before they buy.
```

### 3:00 PM - Behind the Scenes
```
Built TestiFy with:
• Next.js 14
• MongoDB
• Stripe
• Vercel

Total time: 24 hours
First customer: 6 hours after launch

Speed beats perfection.
```

### 6:00 PM - Soft Pitch
```
Just got this question:

"What's the easiest way to collect testimonials?"

Answer: TestiFy

60 seconds to set up.
Customers submit via link.
You approve & display.

That's it.

```

### 9:00 PM - Engagement Question
```
What's your biggest challenge with customer testimonials?

• Asking is awkward?

• Too time-consuming?

Let me know 👇
```

## DAY 2 (TUESDAY) - VALUE DAY

### 9:00 AM - Educational
```
The 3 types of social proof that actually work:

1. User testimonials (customers love you)
2. Wisdom of crowds ("Join 10,000+")
3. Expert endorsements (industry leaders)

For small businesses:
User testimonials = highest ROI

Easy to get. High trust. Maximum conversions.
```

### 12:00 PM - Story
```
My conversion rate before testimonials: 2.1%

My conversion rate after: 3.4%

That's 62% more customers from the same traffic.

Social proof works.

Get testimonials → Display them → Watch sales grow
```

### 3:00 PM - Reply to 10 People

```

### 6:00 PM - Proof
```
Day 2 of TestiFy:

```

### 9:00 PM - Question
```
When do you ask customers for testimonials?

A) Right after project completion
B) One week later
C) When you remember
D) Never (too awkward)

I used to be D.

Now I automate it.

## DAY 3 (WEDNESDAY) - THREAD DAY

### 9:00 AM - Thread (Post in 5 parts)

**Tweet 1:**
```
Your landing page is losing customers.

Here's why 👇
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
You have great product.
Great copy.
Great design.

But visitors don't trust you yet.

They're thinking:
"Is this legit?"
"Has anyone else used this?"
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Social proof fixes this.

But collecting testimonials is painful:
• Chasing customers via email
• Formatting quotes manually
• Updating your website
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
TestiFy automates all of this:
• Send one link
• Collect branded testimonials
• Auto-display on your site
• Done in 60 seconds
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
First 10 customers get it for $4.50/month.

Link in bio.

### 12:00 PM - Value

How to ask for testimonials (without being awkward):

❌ "Can you write me a testimonial?"

✅ "Would you mind sharing your experience? Other customers find it helpful."

Frame it as helping others, not helping you.
```

### 3:00 PM - Engagement
Reply to 10 tweets. Add value first, pitch second.

### 6:00 PM - Social Proof
```
Just got this DM:

"Setup took 2 minutes. Already got my first testimonial."

Love hearing this 🙌

```

### 9:00 PM - Question
```
What's stopping you from collecting testimonials?

A) Don't know how to ask

C) Too time-consuming
D) All of the above

I built TestiFy to solve all of these.
```

## DAY 4 (THURSDAY) - ENGAGEMENT DAY

### 9:00 AM - Educational
```
Where to display testimonials for maximum impact:

1. Above the fold on your homepage
2. Next to your pricing
3. On checkout pages
4. In your email signature
5. On sales pages

Placement matters as much as the testimonials themselves.
```

### 12:00 PM - Story
```
I used to manage testimonials in a Google Doc.

Then I'd:
• Copy the text
• Format it
• Update my website
• Repeat for each one

Took 30 minutes per testimonial.

Now: 0 minutes.

Automation is beautiful.
```

### 3:00 PM - Heavy Engagement
- Search: "just launched"
- Reply to 15 launch tweets with congratulations + soft pitch

Example:
```
Congrats on the launch! 🎉

Pro tip: Have testimonials ready for your landing page. Social proof from day 1 = instant trust.

I built a tool for this if you need it. DM me!
```

### 6:00 PM - Milestone
```
Day 4 of TestiFy:

• 200 website visitors
• 15 signups
• 2 paying customers
• $18 MRR

Progress!

Thanks to everyone who supported 🙏
```

### 9:00 PM - Question
```
Would you rather have:

A) 100 mediocre testimonials
B) 10 incredible testimonials

Quality > Quantity every time.

That's why TestiFy lets you approve every testimonial before it goes live.

Full control.
```

## DAY 5 (FRIDAY) - DIRECT PITCH DAY

### 9:00 AM - Thread (Behind the Scenes)

**Tweet 1:**
```
I built TestiFy in 24 hours.

Here's what I learned 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
1/ Ship fast.

Perfection is the enemy of profit.

My MVP:
• No custom domains
• No video testimonials
• No advanced analytics

Just core features.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
2/ Price aggressively low.

Competitors charge $50-300/month.

I'm at $9.

Why?
• Easier to get first customers
• Volume beats margin early on
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
3/ Build in public.

Sharing my journey got me:
• 3 beta testers
• 2 pre-sales
• Valuable feedback

People root for founders who share.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
4/ Your turn.

What's your SaaS?

The best time to ask for testimonials:

✅ Right after you deliver great work

Strike while the iron is hot.
```
