# 🤖 TESTIFY AUTOMATION ROADMAP

## Legitimate Ways to Automate (No Account Sharing Required)

---

## PHASE 1: EMAIL AUTOMATION (Set up once, runs forever)

### Tool: ConvertKit or Mailchimp (Free tier available)

**What it does:**
- Capture emails from landing page
- Send welcome sequence automatically
- Nurture leads on autopilot
- Announce new features

**Setup (30 minutes):**
1. Create free ConvertKit account
2. Add signup form to TestiFy landing page

**Email 2 (Day 2):** How to get testimonials
```
Subject: The easiest way to ask for testimonials

Quick tip:

The best time to ask for a testimonial is RIGHT after you deliver great work.

Here's the exact message I use:

"Hey [Name], really enjoyed working with you on [project]. 

Would you mind sharing a quick review? It helps other customers know what to expect.

[Takes 60 seconds → Link]"

That's it. No pressure. Just ask.

Try it today!

**Email 3 (Day 4):** Social proof tip
```
Subject: Where to put testimonials for maximum impact

Most people put testimonials on a separate "Reviews" page.

That's wrong.

Put them where decisions happen:
• Homepage (above the fold)
• Pricing page
• Checkout page
• Sales pages

The closer to the "Buy" button, the better.
