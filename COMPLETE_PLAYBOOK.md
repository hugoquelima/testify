### EMAIL 2: How to Ask (Send Day 2)

**Subject:** The easiest way to ask for testimonials

**Body:**
```
Quick tip:

The best time to ask for a testimonial is RIGHT after you deliver great work.

Here's the exact message I use:

---

Hey [Name],

Really enjoyed working with you on [project]. 

Would you mind sharing a quick review? It helps other customers know what to expect, and only takes 60 seconds.

[Your collection link]

Thanks!
Hugo

Frame it as helping others, not helping you. Works every time.

**Settings:** Send "1 day after previous email"

### EMAIL 3: Where to Display (Send Day 4)

**Subject:** Where to put testimonials for maximum impact

**Body:**
```
Most people put testimonials on a separate "Reviews" page.

That's wrong.

Put them where buying decisions happen:

✅ Homepage (above the fold)
✅ Pricing page  
✅ Checkout pages
✅ Sales pages
✅ Next to your "Buy" button

The closer to the purchase decision, the better they convert.

One customer added testimonials to their pricing page and saw a 34% increase in conversions.

Same traffic. More sales.

Try it!

Hugo

P.S. Your TestiFy widget works on any page. Just copy-paste the code.
```

**Settings:** Send "2 days after previous email"

### EMAIL 4: Success Story (Send Day 7)

**Subject:** How Sarah increased conversions 34%

**Body:**
```
Sarah runs a design agency.

She struggled with testimonials for years. Too awkward to ask, too time-consuming to manage.

Then she started using TestiFy:

Week 1: Set up collection page
Week 2: Sent to 10 clients
Week 3: Received 8 testimonials
Week 4: Added widget to her site

The result?

34% increase in inquiry form submissions.

Same website traffic. More clients. Higher rates.

That's the power of social proof.

If Sarah can do it, so can you.

Log into your dashboard and send your collection link today:

Cheers,

## MONDAY (5 TWEETS)

**9:00 AM - Launch Tweet 1:**
```
🚨 I'm launching TestiFy today!

The easiest way to collect and display customer testimonials.

Here's why I built it 🧵👇
```

**12:00 PM - Launch Tweet 2:**
```
I spent $200/month on Trustpilot for 2 years.

Then I realized:
• Their widgets are slow
• They plaster their branding everywhere
• I don't own my own reviews

Something had to change.
```

**3:00 PM - Launch Tweet 3:**
```
So I built TestiFy:

• $9/month (not $200)
• Your branding only
• Full control over what displays
• Setup in 60 seconds
• Beautiful, fast widgets
```

**6:00 PM - Launch Tweet 4:**
```
First 50 people get 50% off forever.

That's $4.50/month for life.

Just reply "TESTIFY" and I'll DM you the link.
```

**9:00 PM - Launch Tweet 5:**
```
Your landing page is losing customers without testimonials.

Fix that today 👇

```

## TUESDAY (5 TWEETS)

**9:00 AM:**
```
Social proof isn't optional anymore.

Your landing page without testimonials = 50% less conversions.

Customers need to trust you before they buy.
```

**12:00 PM:**
```
Built TestiFy with:
• Next.js 14
• MongoDB
• Stripe
• Vercel

Total time: 24 hours
First customer: 6 hours after launch

Speed beats perfection.
```

**3:00 PM:**
```
Just got this question:

"What's the easiest way to collect testimonials?"

Answer: TestiFy

60 seconds to set up.
Customers submit via link.
You approve & display.

That's it.

https://testify-h6td.vercel.app
```

**6:00 PM:**
```
Day 2 of TestiFy:

• 5 signups
• 1 paid customer
• $9 MRR 🎉

Small wins compound.

Onward 🚀
```

**9:00 PM:**
```
What's your biggest challenge with customer testimonials?

• Asking is awkward?
• Don't know what to do with them?
• Too time-consuming?

Let me know 👇
```

---

## WEDNESDAY (5 TWEETS)

**9:00 AM - Thread Start:**
```
Your landing page is losing customers.

Here's why 👇
```

**10:00 AM - Thread Part 2:**
```
You have great product.
Great copy.
Great design.

But visitors don't trust you yet.

They're thinking:
"Is this legit?"
"Has anyone else used this?"
```

**11:00 AM - Thread Part 3:**
```
Social proof fixes this.

But collecting testimonials is painful:
• Chasing customers via email
• Formatting quotes manually
• Updating your website
```

**12:00 PM - Thread Part 4:**
```
TestiFy automates all of this:
• Send one link
• Collect branded testimonials
• Auto-display on your site
• Done in 60 seconds
```

**1:00 PM - Thread Final:**
```
First 10 customers get it for $4.50/month.

Link in bio.

(RT to help a founder out 🙏)
```

**6:00 PM:**
```
Just got this DM:

"Setup took 2 minutes. Already got my first testimonial."

Love hearing this 🙌

## THURSDAY (5 TWEETS)

**9:00 AM:**
```
The 3 types of social proof that actually work:

1. User testimonials (customers love you)
2. Wisdom of crowds ("Join 10,000+")
3. Expert endorsements (industry leaders)

For small businesses:
User testimonials = highest ROI
```

**12:00 PM:**
```
I used to manage testimonials in a Google Doc.

Then I'd:
• Copy the text
• Format it
• Update my website
• Repeat for each one

Took 30 minutes per testimonial.

Now: 0 minutes.

Automation is beautiful.
```

**3:00 PM:**
```
Where to display testimonials for maximum impact:

1. Above the fold on your homepage
2. Near your pricing
3. On checkout pages
4. In your email signature
5. On sales pages

Placement matters as much as the testimonials themselves.
```

**6:00 PM:**
```
Day 4 of TestiFy:

• 200 website visitors
• 15 signups
• 2 paying customers
• $18 MRR

Progress!

Thanks to everyone who supported 🙏
```

**9:00 PM:**
```
Would you rather have:

A) 100 mediocre testimonials
B) 10 incredible testimonials

Quality > Quantity every time.

That's why TestiFy lets you approve every testimonial before it goes live.

Full control.
```

## FRIDAY (5 TWEETS)

**9:00 AM:**
```
I built TestiFy in 24 hours.

Here's what I learned 🧵

1/ Ship fast.

Perfection is the enemy of profit.

My MVP:
• No custom domains
• No video testimonials
• No advanced analytics

Just core features.
```

**10:00 AM:**
```
2/ Price aggressively low.

Competitors charge $50-300/month.

I'm at $9.

Why?
• Easier to get first customers
• Volume beats margin early on
```

**11:00 AM:**
```
3/ Build in public.

Sharing my journey got me:
• 3 beta testers
• 2 pre-sales
• Valuable feedback

People root for founders who share.
```

**12:00 PM:**
```
4/ Your turn.

What's your SaaS?

Drop it below. I'll retweet my favorites.

Let's grow together 🚀
```

**6:00 PM:**
```
I need your help 🙏

TestiFy is helping businesses collect testimonials effortlessly.

If you know any:
