I built TestiFy because I was tired of paying $200/month for Trustpilot.

Now I collect testimonials in 60 seconds for $9/month.

Here's how it works 🧵👇

## PHASE 2: CONTENT STRATEGY (Daily Posting)

### Content Mix (Post 3-5x per day)

**Morning Post (9 AM) - Educational**
Example:
```
Social proof isn't optional anymore.

Your landing page without testimonials = 50% less conversions.

Customers need to trust you before they buy.

Collect testimonials → Display them → Watch sales grow.
```

**Midday Post (12 PM) - Story/Behind Scenes**
Example:
```
Built TestiFy in 24 hours.

Stack:
• Next.js 14
• MongoDB
• Stripe
• Vercel

First customer signed up 6 hours after launch.

Speed beats perfection. Ship fast.
```

**Afternoon Post (3 PM) - Value/How-To**
Example:
```
How to collect testimonials (the easy way):

1. Finish project
2. Send customer this link → [your collection URL]
3. They submit in 60 seconds
4. Approve & display on your site

No chasing. No formatting. No hassle.

Automation is beautiful.
```

**Evening Post (6 PM) - Social Proof/Results**
Example:
```
Just got this DM:

"Added TestiFy to my site yesterday. Already got 3 new testimonials."

Love seeing customers win 🙌

If you're not collecting testimonials yet:

```

**Night Post (9 PM) - Engagement/Question**
Example:
```
What's your biggest challenge with customer testimonials?

• Asking is awkward?
• Don't know what to do with them?
• Too time-consuming?

Let me know 👇
```

## PHASE 3: ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY (Daily)

### The 30-Minute Daily Routine

**10 Minutes - Reply to Big Accounts:**
- Find 10 tweets from accounts with 10K+ followers
- Reply with genuine insights
- Add value, don't promote

Example replies:
```
Original tweet: "Launching my product tomorrow"
Your reply: "Excited for you! Pro tip: Have testimonials ready for launch day. Social proof from day 1 = instant trust."
```

**10 Minutes - Reply to Your Niche:**
- Search: "testimonials", "social proof", "customer reviews"
- Reply to people asking questions
- Soft pitch when relevant

Example:
```
Tweet: "How do you collect testimonials?"
Reply: "I built a tool for this - customers submit via link, you approve, auto-displays on site. 60 second setup. DM me if you want early access!"
```

**10 Minutes - Engage With Followers:**
- Reply to every comment on your tweets
- Like 20 tweets from your followers
- Quote tweet 2 interesting posts

---

## PHASE 4: CONVERSION TACTICS

### Soft Pitch Templates (Use 2-3x per day)

**When someone complains about Trustpilot:**
```
Same! That's why I built TestiFy. $9/month instead of $200+.

Happy to give you early access if you want to try it.
```

**When someone asks for tool recommendations:**
```
I built TestiFy for exactly this! $9/month, 60-second setup.

DM me for the link if you're interested.
```

**When someone talks about conversions:**
```
Testimonials increased my conversion rate by 34%.

Social proof is underrated.

## PHASE 5: THREAD STRATEGY (2x per week)

**Thread Formula:**
- Hook (pain point)
- Story (your experience)
- Solution (TestiFy)
- CTA (link/offer)

**Thread 1: The Problem**
```
Your landing page is losing customers.

Here's why 👇

1/ You have great product.
Great copy.
Great design.

But visitors don't trust you yet.

2/ They're thinking:
"Is this legit?"
"Has anyone else used this?"
"Will I get scammed?"

3/ Social proof fixes this.

But collecting testimonials is painful:
• Chasing customers via email
• Formatting quotes manually
• Updating your website

4/ TestiFy automates all of this:
• Send one link
• Collect branded testimonials
• Auto-display on your site
• Done in 60 seconds

5/ First 10 customers get it for $4.50/month.

Link in bio.
```

**Thread 2: Behind the Scenes**
```
I built TestiFy in 24 hours.

Here's what I learned 🧵

1/ Ship fast.

Perfection is the enemy of profit.

My MVP:
• No custom domains
• No video testimonials
• No advanced analytics

Just core features.

2/ Price aggressively low.

Competitors: $50-300/month
Me: $9

Why?
• Easier to get first customers
• Volume beats margin early on

3/ Build in public.

Sharing my journey got me:
• 3 beta testers
• 2 pre-sales
• Valuable feedback

4/ Your turn.

## PHASE 7: TRACKING & OPTIMIZATION

### Daily Metrics to Track

Create a simple spreadsheet:

### What's Working?

**Analyze weekly:**

- Which replies led to DMs?

**Double down on what works.**
**Kill what doesn't.**
