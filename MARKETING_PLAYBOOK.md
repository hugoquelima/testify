## PART 2: CONTENT TEMPLATES (Copy & Paste)

### 🐦 TWITTER/X THREADS

**Thread 1: Launch Announcement**
```
🚨 I'm launching TestiFy today!

The easiest way to collect and display customer testimonials.

Here's why I built it 🧵👇

1/ I spent $200/month on Trustpilot for 2 years.

Then I realized:
• Their widgets are slow
• They plaster their branding everywhere
• I don't own my own reviews

2/ So I built TestiFy:
• $9/month (not $200)
• Your branding only
• Full control over what displays
• Setup in 60 seconds

3/ First 50 people get 50% off forever.

Just reply "TESTIFY" and I'll DM you the link.

(RT to help a founder out 🙏)
```

**Thread 2: The Problem/Solution**
```
Your landing page is losing customers.

Here's why 👇

You have great product.
Great copy.
Great design.

But visitors don't trust you yet.

They're thinking:
"Is this legit?"
"Has anyone else used this?"
"Will I get scammed?"

Social proof fixes this.

But collecting testimonials is painful:
• Chasing customers via email
• Formatting quotes manually
• Updating your website

TestiFy automates all of this:
• Send one link
• Collect branded testimonials
• Auto-display on your site
• Done in 60 seconds

First 10 customers get it for $4.50/month.

Link in bio.
```

**Thread 3: Behind the Scenes**
```
I built TestiFy in 24 hours.

Tech stack:
• Next.js 14
• MongoDB
• Stripe
• Tailwind CSS

Here's what I learned 🧵

1/ Ship fast.

Perfection is the enemy of profit.

My MVP:
• No custom domains
• No video testimonials
• No advanced analytics

Just core features that solve the problem.

2/ Price aggressively low.

Competitors charge $50-300/month.

I'm at $9.

Why?
• Easier to get first customers
• Volume beats margin early on
• Can always raise prices later

3/ Focus on one channel.

Don't try to be everywhere.

I'm picking:
• Twitter for awareness
• Reddit for targeted reach
• Product Hunt for launch

Master one before adding others.

4/ Build in public.

Sharing my journey got me:
• 3 beta testers
• 2 pre-sales
• Valuable feedback

People root for founders who share.

5/ Your turn.

What's your SaaS?

Drop it below. I'll retweet my favorites.

Let's grow together 🚀
```

**Single Tweets (Post Daily):**

```
Social proof isn't optional anymore.

It's the difference between:
• 2% conversion
• 5% conversion

That's 2.5x more customers from the same traffic.

Collect testimonials → Display them → Watch conversions soar
```

```
Just helped a customer add testimonials to their Shopify store.

Result: 34% increase in add-to-cart rate.

Social proof works.
```

```
I used to spend 2 hours/week managing testimonials.

Now: 2 minutes.

Automation is beautiful.
```

```
Your competitors have testimonials.

You don't.

Who do you think customers trust more?

### 📱 REDDIT POSTS

**r/SaaS - Launch Post**
```
I built a $9/month alternative to Trustpilot

Hey r/SaaS!

I've been running an agency for 3 years and always struggled with collecting testimonials.

Existing solutions were either:
• Too expensive ($200+/month)
• Too complicated
• Covered in their own branding

So I built TestiFy:

What it does:
• Creates a branded testimonial collection page
• Customers submit via simple link
• You approve/review before publishing
• One-click embed on your website
• $9/month flat

Tech stack:
• Next.js 14
• MongoDB
• Stripe
• Deployed on Vercel

Would love your feedback!

What's your biggest pain point with collecting testimonials?

Edit: Wow, thanks for the support! Link is in my profile if you want to check it out.

How I increased conversions 34% with one simple change

TL;DR: Added customer testimonials to my landing page using a tool I built.

Full story:

I run a small design agency. Landing page was converting at 2.1%.

Not terrible, but not great.

I knew testimonials would help, but the process was painful:
• Emailing clients
• Waiting for replies
• Formatting quotes
• Updating the website

So I built a simple tool to automate it.

Now:
• Send one link to clients
• They submit a branded testimonial
• I approve it
• It appears on my site automatically

Results after 30 days:
• 34% increase in conversion rate
• 2.8% → 3.8%
• 5 new clients from the same traffic

The tool is called TestiFy.

Happy to answer questions about:
• Building SaaS products
• Conversion optimization
• Marketing for agencies

What's working for you?

Freelancers: How do you collect testimonials?

I've been freelancing for 2 years and just realized:

I have 50+ happy clients.
But only 3 testimonials on my website.

Why?
Because asking is awkward and managing them is a pain.

I built a simple system:
1. Automated email after project completion
2. One-click submission for client
3. I review and approve
4. Auto-displays on my portfolio

Took my portfolio from 3 to 18 testimonials in 2 weeks.

More social proof = more trust = higher rates

How do you handle testimonials?

The Psychology of Social Proof (And How to Use It)

Social proof isn't just "nice to have."

It's a psychological trigger that directly impacts buying decisions.

Here's the science + how to implement it:

**Why it works:**

Humans are tribal. We look to others to validate our decisions.

When we see others trusting a brand, our brain goes:
"If they trust it, it's probably safe for me too."

**Types of social proof:**

1. Expert (industry leaders endorse you)
2. Celebrity (influencers use your product)
3. User (regular customers love you)
4. Wisdom of crowds ("Join 10,000+ customers")
5. Wisdom of friends (friends recommend you)

**Most effective for small businesses:**

User testimonials + Wisdom of crowds

Why?
• Easiest to get
• Most relatable
• Highest trust factor

**How to collect them:**

Timing is everything. Ask when:
• Project just completed (they're happy)
• They just gave positive feedback
• They renewed/upsold

Make it easy:
• One-click submission
• Prompt with specific questions
• Offer incentive (discount on next purchase)

**How to display them:**

• Above the fold on landing pages
• Near CTAs
• In email sequences
• On checkout pages (reduces cart abandonment)

**Tools I use:**

Built my own (TestiFy) because existing solutions were $200+/month.

What tools do you use for social proof?
```
