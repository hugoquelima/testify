# TestiFy Sales Strategy 🎯

## Product Positioning

**TestiFy** = The easiest way to collect and display customer testimonials

**Target Market:**
1. Freelancers ( designers, developers, writers )
2. Small agencies ( 2-20 people )
3. SaaS founders ( pre-revenue to $10k MRR )
4. E-commerce stores ( Shopify, WooCommerce )
5. Service businesses ( consultants, coaches, agencies )

**Pain Points We Solve:**
- "I know I need testimonials but don't know how to ask"
- "Trustpilot is too expensive"
- "I don't want to code a solution"
- "I forget to follow up with customers"
- "I don't know which testimonials to display"

---

## Pricing Strategy

**$9/month** - Sweet spot for micro-SaaS
- Low enough to be impulse buy
- High enough to be profitable with 100 customers = $900/month
- 7-day free trial (no credit card)

**Why this works:**
- Competitors charge $50-300/month
- We offer 80% of value at 15% of price
- Easy to justify ROI (one customer converted pays for months)

## Marketing Copy Templates

### Cold Email Template

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company] testimonials

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] doesn't have many customer testimonials on your website.

I built a tool that makes collecting testimonials effortless - just share a link with customers and they submit in 60 seconds.

Would you be open to trying it free for 7 days?

### Twitter Thread Template

I spent $200/month on Trustpilot for 2 years.
