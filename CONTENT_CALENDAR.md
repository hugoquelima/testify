Adding testimonials above your CTA can increase click-through rates by 30%.

Why? Because visitors need to trust you before they buy.

Social proof builds that trust instantly.

### Evening (8 PM)
**X/Twitter:** Behind the scenes
```
Building TestiFy taught me 3 things:

1. Ship fast. Perfection kills momentum.
2. Talk to customers before building. I almost added features nobody wanted.
3. Price based on value, not cost.

What have you learned from building?
```

## THURSDAY 🎯

The 5 types of social proof:

1. Expert (industry leaders)
